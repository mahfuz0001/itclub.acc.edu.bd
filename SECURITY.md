# Security and Error Handling Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive security and error handling improvements implemented in the ACC IT Club website.

## Security Improvements

### 1. Firebase Configuration Security
- Added environment variable validation with fallbacks
- Implemented proper error handling for Firebase initialization
- Added dev/prod environment checks
- Removed hardcoded secrets and credentials

### 2. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented per-IP rate limiting on all API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive input sanitization using DOMPurify
- **Response Filtering**: Removed sensitive fields from API responses
- **Request Validation**: Added parameter validation and bounds checking
- **Error Response Security**: Sanitized error messages to prevent information leakage

### 3. Middleware Security
- Added comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Implemented bot and crawler detection
- Added CORS configuration
- Added suspicious user agent blocking
- Configured proper Content Security Policy

### 4. Form Security
- Enhanced form validation with strict input validation
- Added character limits and format validation
- Implemented XSS prevention through input sanitization
- Added rate limiting for form submissions
- Enhanced email and URL validation with domain checks

## Error Handling Improvements

### 1. Centralized Error Handling
- Created comprehensive error handling utilities
- Implemented safe error message extraction
- Added context-aware error logging
- Created Firebase-specific error mappings

### 2. User Experience
- Added loading states and error boundaries
- Implemented retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Created proper loading overlays and states

### 3. Developer Experience
- Added comprehensive logging without exposing sensitive data
- Implemented error context tracking
- Added development vs production error handling
- Created consistent error handling patterns

## File Structure

### New Utility Files
- `lib/utils/error-handler.ts` - Centralized error handling utilities
- `lib/utils/validation.ts` - Input validation and sanitization
- `components/error-boundary.tsx` - React error boundary component
- `components/ui/loading.tsx` - Loading components
- `middleware.ts` - Security middleware

### Enhanced Files
- All API routes (`app/api/*`) - Added security and error handling
- Firebase config - Added validation and fallbacks
- Auth provider - Enhanced with retry mechanisms and error handling
- Admin pages - Added comprehensive validation and error handling
- Join form - Enhanced validation and security

## Security Headers Implemented

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME sniffing
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Forces HTTPS
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features

## Rate Limiting

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `/api/members` | 10 requests | 1 minute |
| `/api/news` | 20 requests | 1 minute |
| `/api/panelists` | 15 requests | 1 minute |
| `/api/gallery` | 15 requests | 1 minute |
| Join form | 3 submissions | 1 hour per email |

## Input Validation

### Form Fields
- Name: 2-100 characters, letters and basic punctuation only
- Email: Valid email format, max 254 characters
- Phone: 10-15 digits, valid phone format
- URLs: Valid URL format with domain checks for social media
- Text areas: Character limits with real-time feedback

### Technical Skills
- Maximum 10 selections
- Additional validation for custom entries
- Character limits on custom text

### Achievements and Descriptions
- Maximum 1000 characters
- Real-time character counting
- XSS prevention through sanitization

## Environment Variables

### Required Firebase Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
```

### Optional Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
NODE_ENV
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Fail Securely**: Graceful error handling without exposing internals
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal data exposure in APIs
4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive client and server-side validation
5. **Error Logging**: Secure logging without sensitive data
6. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
7. **Content Security**: Prevents XSS and injection attacks

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. ✅ Set all required environment variables
2. ✅ Test all forms with various inputs
3. ✅ Verify API rate limiting works
4. ✅ Check error handling in various scenarios
5. ✅ Ensure HTTPS is enforced
6. ✅ Verify CSP headers are working
7. ✅ Test admin authentication flows
8. ✅ Check mobile responsiveness
9. ✅ Verify loading states work properly
10. ✅ Test error boundaries catch exceptions

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor error logs for patterns
- Review rate limiting effectiveness
- Update dependencies regularly
- Review and rotate API keys
- Monitor for new security vulnerabilities
- Regular security audits of form submissions
